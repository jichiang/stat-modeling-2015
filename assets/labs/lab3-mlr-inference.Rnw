\section*{Lab 3: Parameter inference in multiple linear regression}

To better understand the sampling distribution of our the fitted $\beta$ regression coefficients, you will perform several small simulation studies. The basic code for the simulation study can be found in the \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickreich/stat-modeling-2015/gh-pages/assets/labs/sampling-distribution-simulation.R}{sampling-distribution-simulation.R} file. 
Open this code file and read it carefully. In all, this code is running a small simulation study to generate a ``sampling distribution'' of the regression coefficients for a simple linear regression model
$ {\mathbb E}[y|x] = \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot x $
where both $x$ and $y$ are simulated data. Try to understand what each line of code is doing before you run the file, and then run it all the way through.

\begin{exercise}
In a few sentences, describe in your own words the procedure followed by the simulation study.
\end{exercise}

In a simulation study like this, we might be interested in several different characteristics of our fitted models. We may be interested in how often we reject the null hypothesis that $\beta_1$=0; in how wide the confidence intervals are on average; how accurate the $\hat\beta_1$ are on average; how much variability do we see in the $\hat\beta_1$ estimates; etc...

\begin{exercise}
Compute the 95\% confidence interval coverage for $\beta_1$. That is, calculate the 95\% confidence interval for each estimated $\beta_1$ and compute the percentage of times that the confidence interval covered the true value of $\beta_1$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Also, compute the mean squared error of your estimates of $\beta_1$. This can be computed as $MSE=\sum_{i=1}^{M}(\hat\beta_{1,i} - \beta_1)^2/M$, where $M$ is the number of simulations that you ran.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Given the parameters defined at the top of the file, determine what the sampling distribution for $\beta_1$ should be. That is, determine analytically what ${\mathbb E}[\hat\beta_1]$ and $Var[\hat\beta_1]$ are. Hint: use the formulae provided in the slides.
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
Using the estimated values of the $\hat\beta_1$, calulate summary metrics and or use appropriate visualizations to determine whether these your simulated distribution of $\hat\beta_1$ match up with with the theoretical distribution (i.e. with ${\mathbb E}[\hat\beta_1]$ and $Var[\hat\beta_1]$).
\end{exercise}

The top rows of the code file define a set of parameters that are used by the simulation study. Experiment with modifying them, and observe how the results change. 

\begin{exercise}
For three new combinations of parameters, calculate the 95\% CI coverage and the MSE. Report the results for these three new sets of parameters and the original set of parameters in a table, with one row for each parameter set, and a column for each metric, including the expected value and variance of $\hat\beta_1$. Hint: it may be easier to make vectors of the parameters, and then loop through each combination and for each set of paramters, run the full simulation $M$ times.
\end{exercise}


Adapt the simulation to simulate data for two covariates, $x_1$ and $x_2$, using {\tt mvrnorm()}. To start, assume that both $x_1$ and $x_2$ have mean 0 and variance 1. However, define $x_1$ and $x_2$ so that you may modify the degree of correlation between them, using a correlation parameter $\rho$.

\begin{exercise}
 Run the original simulation again for two scenarios, one with low and one with high correlation. Add a row to your table above reporting the results from this simulation
\end{exercise}

For this lab, you should submit a modified version of the original code file, embedded into an RMarkdown document, with any figures used and a single table showing your results.
